# Academix

Academix is an attempt to make computer science topics more interactive and easy to understand. You might be sitting in your discrete mathematics class and wondering why do we study this topic? Nobody uses set theory in real life, right? And you would be totally correct[*]

[*] - We might not use set theory or for the matter any topic like we do in an academic setting. We would be using these topics intutively and unknowingly in our day to day life.

We, at academix have just one little goal - we want you to think of the nitty gritty details of a computer science subject not as a means to pass an exam and get a bachelors degree, but as a tool in your toolbox that you can use to solve real world problems.

## Tools by Academix

- ...It is a work in progress. We are constantly adding new tools and content to make your learning experience better.

## Contributing

We are always looking for contributors to help us improve the content and tools. For developing locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev-Mehta/Academix.git
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

- We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager. You can install it using the following command:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

4. Run the django server

> First time setup
```
cd backend
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate // or venv\Scripts\activate on windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add more tools
- [ ] Add more content
- [ ] Add interactive examples
- [ ] Add more future plans
- [ ] Deploy django backend on a server
